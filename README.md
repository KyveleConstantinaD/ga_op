# ga_op (Genetic Algorithm for the Orienteering Problem)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to solve the Orienteering Problem (OP). 
Two different methods for initial population are available. 
Two different methods for parent selection are available; tournament and the new proposed methodology
Based on the above selections 4 algorithm variations can be excecuted (ga_op_1_1, ga_op_2_1, ga_op_1_2, ga_op_2_2). 
The algorithm can run for the following problem sets: Tsiligirides 1 (corrected), Tsiligirides 2, Set 130 (Faigl, 2019)
